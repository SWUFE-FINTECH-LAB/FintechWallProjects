# Wind Market Wallboard – Development Guide

## 1. Overview & Scope
- **Goal**: Deliver a 1-minute looping, multi-scene market intelligence wallboard that gives an instant snapshot of global markets.
- **Form Factor**: 16:9 4K horizontal display (55–65″) running in kiosk mode, auto-start and auto-reconnect.
- **Scene Rotation**: Five scenes (A–E) cycling every 20–45 seconds; full loop ≤ 60 seconds. Order and dwell times adjust to the active trading session.
- **Target Users**: Trading desks, classrooms, or briefing rooms that need fast situational awareness without manual interaction.
- **Variants**:
  - **Wind Edition** – Uses WindPy/WAPI as the authoritative data source with open/free feeds as backups.
  - **Open Edition** – Uses only non-commercial open or free APIs; must be deployable without Wind access while preserving the same UI/UX experience.

## 2. Product Variants
### 2.1 Shared Principles
- Identical user experience, layout, and scene logic across editions.
- Unified payload schema so the frontend and carousel logic remain unchanged.
- Edition chosen via configuration (`DATA_MODE=wind|open`) with per-metric overrides for testing.
- Both editions maintain Redis caches keyed by `source`, enabling parallel operation.

### 2.2 Wind Edition
- **Primary Sources**: WindPy/WAPI for global indices, futures main contracts, FX, rates, macro calendar, industry classifications, and implied volatility metrics.
- **Fallbacks**: Public APIs where permissible (e.g., CoinGecko for crypto, FRED for US yields).
- **Credential Handling**: Requires Wind terminal credentials; schedule keep-alive heartbeats to prevent session expiry.

### 2.3 Open Edition
- **Primary Sources**: Public/non-commercial data providers such as Yahoo Finance, Stooq, Twelve Data, ECB, AlphaVantage, FRED, U.S. Treasury, MAS, CME FedWatch CSV, CoinGecko, Binance/OKX, and official RSS feeds.
- **Constraints**: Observe attribution/licensing requirements; some endpoints have rate limits or delayed data.
- **Fallbacks**: Alternative free feeds or cached last-known values to preserve parity with Wind Edition.

## 6. System Architecture
### 6.1 High-Level Components
- **Data Ingestion Service (Python)**:
  - Runs Wind adaptor (Wind Edition) or open-source adaptor (Open Edition).
  - Schedules pull jobs by asset class; normalises to shared schema.
  - Writes payloads into Redis with versioning and timestamps.
- **Realtime Stream Service (Node/TypeScript)**:
  - Manages WebSocket subscriptions (crypto, high-frequency FX).
  - Aggregates streams, applies backoff, and broadcasts consolidated WebSocket to frontend.
- **REST/GraphQL API**: Exposes cached snapshots for low-frequency data (calendar, heatmap).
- **Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)**:
  - Renders scenes, handles carousel timing, kiosk full-screen, offline cache.
  - Consumes REST/WebSocket endpoints agnostic of edition.
- **Configuration Module**:
  - Environment-driven edition toggle, session schedules, refresh intervals.
- **Monitoring & Logging**:
  - Structured logs with source metadata, latency, and error codes.
  - Health endpoints per service; optional Grafana dashboards.

### 6.2 Deployment
- Containerised services orchestrated via Docker Compose or Kubernetes (optional).
- Kiosk hosts (mini PC / Raspberry Pi) run Chromium in kiosk mode with auto-start scripts.
- Persistent volume for cached payloads to enable warm restart when network is down.

## 7. Data Refresh & Resilience
- **Refresh Cadence**:
  - Spot FX & crypto: 5–15 seconds.
  - Rates, implied vol, heatmap: 1–5 minutes.
  - Economic calendar: 60 minutes when upcoming, 1–5 minutes within 2 hours of event.
  - News ticker: 30–60 seconds.
- **Fallback Workflow**:
  1. Attempt primary source within SLA.
  2. On timeout, call fallback source.
  3. If fallback fails, surface cached value with “stale” badge and timestamp.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Detect abnormal values (z-score thresholds) and clamp or flag.
  - Expose last successful update time in API responses.
- **Persistence**:
  - Store last payload to disk; load on startup.
  - Keep per-scene TTL configuration to avoid over-fetching.

## 8. Data Modeling
- **Canonical Payload** (JSON):
  - `indices`, `commodities`, `fx`, `rates`, `crypto`, `calendar`, `heatmap`, `volTerm`, `stablecoinFlows`, `news`, `metadata`.
  - Each entry includes `code`, `label`, `value`, `changePct`, `timestamp`, `source`.
  - `metadata` includes edition (`wind`/`open`), refresh timestamps, licence notes.
- **Historical Arrays**: Provide mini-series (`spark`) arrays for sparklines and term-structure visualisations.
- **Calendar Items**: `event`, `importance`, `time_local`, `time_sgt`, `previous`, `consensus`, `actual`, `status` (`upcoming|released`).
- **Heatmap Model**: Hierarchical sectors → industries → tickers with `weight`, `changePct`, `turnover`.

## 9. Implementation Roadmap
1. **Foundation**
   - Set up repo structure, common config, Redis instance.
   - Implement provider abstraction with Wind and Open implementations for Scene A metrics.
2. **Data Coverage Expansion**
   - Add modules for Scenes B–E data; wire crypto WebSocket aggregation.
   - Implement fallback chains and caching policies.
3. **Frontend MVP**
   - Build layout grid, marquee, scene shells, and carousel controller with mock data.
4. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Integrate Lightweight Charts/ECharts for heatmaps/yield curves/vol term structures.
   - Add stablecoin flow visualisations and risk alert banner (e.g., VIX or 2s10s inversion).
5. **Session Scheduling & Theming**
   - Implement time-of-day weighting, auto dark mode, and kiosk preferences.
6. **Resilience & Monitoring**
   - Simulate API outages; verify fallback behaviour; add logging/alerts.
7. **Packaging & Delivery**
   - Create deployment scripts, kiosk autostart configs, and admin documentation.

## 10. Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests**: Provider adaptors, schema validation, conversion utilities.
- **Integration Tests**: Fetch → normalise → cache flows for both editions using mocked API responses.
- **UI Tests**: Snapshot tests for scene layouts, visual regression checks.
- **Failover Tests**: Simulate primary source outage (Wind server down, API rate limit) to ensure fallback and stale indicators fire.
- **Performance Tests**: Verify WebSocket throughput and browser rendering at 4K.

## 11. Operational Considerations
- **Credentials**: Securely store Wind credentials (Wind Edition) and API keys (Open Edition) using environment variables or secrets manager.
- **Attribution**: Display data source disclaimer per edition in a footer or settings overlay.
- **Maintenance**: Schedule job to refresh session schedule rules (holidays) and update symbol lists.
- **Compliance**: Review licences for public APIs to ensure permitted display; maintain audit trail of data usage.

## 12. Risks & Open Questions
- **Licensing**: Confirm redistribution rights for Wind data and for each open API (many forbid commercial display).
- **Data Completeness**: Open Edition may lack certain metrics (e.g., iron ore continuous contract); define acceptable substitutes or explicit omissions.
- **Calendar Reliability**: Open sources can lag; consider manual overrides for critical events.
- **WebSocket Limits**: Ensure Binance/OKX allow long-lived kiosk connections; plan for reconnect/backoff.
- **Edition Drift**: Establish automated regression tests so UI gracefully handles missing metrics in Open Edition.
